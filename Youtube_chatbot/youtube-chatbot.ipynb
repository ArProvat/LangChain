It discusses the use of quantum mechanics simulations on quantum mechanics simulations on computational clusters to generate large amounts of data, which can be used to create as much simulation data as possible. The video also talks about the need for more efficient and accurate functional approximations to simulate large materials and the building of such functionals. The video suggests that a functional that approximates Schrodinger's equation and allows for the description of molecular properties can be used to simulate large materials.\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":59},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
